--> Short Answer Questions

1. What is the difference between <Link> and <NavLink> in React Router?
Ans - <Link> is used to move between pages without reload. <NavLink> is same but it gives an active class to show which page is open.

2. Explain the purpose of the useNavigate() hook.
Ans - useNavigate() is used to go from one page to another by code. Example: navigate("/home") goes to the home page.

3. What are dynamic routes in React Router? Give an example.
Ans - Dynamic routes are routes that can change based on the data or parameters passed in the URL. Instead of hardcoding every route, we can use dynamic parts like :id to make routes flexible.

4. How can you handle undefined or invalid routes in React?
Ans - In React Router, we can handle undefined or wrong routes by using a wildcard route with path="*". This route will match any URL that doesn’t exist in our defined routes and can show a “Page Not Found” message.

5. What is the use of the useParams() hook?
Ans - useParams() is used to get values from the URL. Example: from /user/:id, it gives the id.
